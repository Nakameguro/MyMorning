# MyMorning

## Prerequisite: Install Node.js and npm

If Node.js and npm aren't already on your machine, install them. Our examples require node v5.x.x or higher and npm 3.x.x or higher. To check which version you are using, run node -v and npm -v in a terminal window.

## Install packages

To install via npm:

```bash
cd MyMorning/web
npm install
```

Error messages—in red—might appear during the install, and you might see npm WARN messages. As long as there are no npm ERR! messages at the end, you can assume success.

## Build and run the application

Open a terminal window and enter this command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
